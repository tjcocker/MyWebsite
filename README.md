# Welcome

This repo is for tracking changes to my website. The purpose of the website is for a portfolio of tools I've used, plus learning and expanding my knowledge of new testing tools, automation, languages, etc.

## Goal

My main goal is to get as many tests on the website as quickly as possible and learn a wide array of testing techniques, instead of building out larger tests with just a few tools. Later I'll go back and learn ways to imrove and expand on tests. A sort of agile development process.

## Tests

See the Actions tab above for tests running on every push.
