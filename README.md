Hello,

This repo is for tracking changes to my website. The purpose of the website is for a portfolio of tools I've used, plus learning and expanding my knowledge of new testing tools, languages, etc.

My main goal is to get as many examples on the website as quickly as possible, instead of building out larger tests with just a few tools. A sort of agile development process. Later I'll go back and improve/expand on tests.

This is a work in progress. Please feel free to suggest any changes or additions. 

Thanks!

Tim
