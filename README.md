Hello,

This repo is for tracking changes to my website. The purpose of the website is for learning: New testing tools, JavaScript, Python, C#, etc. 

As a tester I wanted to have different things to test. A live JS weather app, a to-do list, and eventually an android app. 

Testing Tools: Selenium IDE, Playwright with TypeScript, Cypress, Postman, TestComplete, Katalon, k6, etc. Does this website need all the tests? No, but it's fun!

This is a work in progress. Please feel free to suggest any changes or additions. 

Thanks!
Tim
