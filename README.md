Hello,

This repo is for tracking changes to my website. The purpose of the website is for learning: New testing tools, languages, CI, frameworks, etc.

My main goal is to get as many examples of tools I'm familiar with and learning on the website as quickly as possible, instead of building out large tests with just a few tools.  

This is a work in progress. Please feel free to suggest any changes or additions. 

Thanks!
Tim
